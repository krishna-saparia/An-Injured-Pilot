  storyText: "God to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy.You
    see a crate with all manner of pipes,wires and cogs scattered within it mostly
    trash.\n\nYou could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with one of
    the pipes. Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some kind
    of leverage.Maybe mini pulley system with those wires and the cogs .\n\nHow to
    proceed?\n1. No time to waste . Grab the pipe and start wacking.\n2.Take the
    time to build a leverage-gadget.\n "
